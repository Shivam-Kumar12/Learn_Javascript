Call Stack in JavaScript
The call stack is a mechanism JavaScript uses to keep track of function calls. It works like a stack of plates, where the last plate placed on the top is the first one to be removed. Here's how it works in simple terms:

Function Call:

When a function is called, it's added to the call stack.
Execute Function:

The function at the top of the stack is executed.
Function Completes:

When the function finishes executing, it's removed from the stack.
Resume Execution:

The program then continues executing the next function in the stack.
